# STAG-1
STAG-1 is an open-source rocketry data logging and flight computer based around the RP2040 microprocessor. The flight computer will measure, log and transmit live data during its flight on the rocketâ€™s attitude, position and environment. 
The project will provide students with hands-on experience working with rocketry and flight avionics and electronic systems.
